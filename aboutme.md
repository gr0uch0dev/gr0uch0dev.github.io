Groucho showed up in the net at a very young age, devouring knowledge over IRC channels. At that time in his small village the only place with a modest connection was an internet point. He started to trade IT maintenance for free access to the net and (lots of) coke drinks. He will never forget the rushing lunches and the school days skipped just to head to that keyboard.

Although mainly interested in sysadmin and security he then came into two books that were going to switch his focus from tech to programming. These books were “Programming in C” by King and the holy “Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs”. With the latter playing also a pivotal role in the development of his love for mathematics, Algebra in particular.

Then at 18, obese and rejected by girls, he decided to challenge himself and lost 60kilos in 6 months. Then girls came and the time spent on the keyboard went somewhere else. His passion for tech started cooling down.

At 19 a book was going to cause a 180 degree turn in his life. It was a hot summer when he came into contact with “The Black Swan” by Taleb. At that time he had never heard about financial markets but he became soon fascinated about the concepts of measuring risk and probability theory.

So fascinated that he decided to pursue an academic career in Economics and Quantitative Finance, dreaming of a job in trading the financial markets. At that time finding profits looked to him like exploits in code. But whatever the excuses he was telling himself it was not his life and as soon as he finished his studies he went back to the keyboard and worked as a full stack software developer. The technological hearth was warming up again.

Then a working project put him in contact with the blockchain and the cryptocurrencies ecosystem. Witnessing how the application of cryptographic protocols and game theory could create new economic and social protocols made him rediscover his childhood passion of decentralized economies and anarchism.

Then he decided to solidify his mathematical understanding of the primitives around this world.
He is now enrolled in a college degree in  mathematics. The latter with the aim to increase the toolkit at his disposal to actively contribute to crypto projects.

Groucho’s main interests span among: protocols for anonymous transactions, security, decentralized finance, game theory and cryptography. All topics he was used to read about only in sci-fi novels.

If you have any project in one of these areas just ping him, or if for any reason you’d like to contribute to Groucho’s studies, just hit him with a donation.
