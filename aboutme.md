title: About me
---
Groucho showed up in the net at a very young age, devouring knowledge over IRC channels. At that time in his small village the only place with a modest connection was an internet point. He started to trade IT maintenance for free access to the net and (lots of) coke drinks. He will never forget the rushing lunches and the school days skipped just to head to that keyboard.

Although mainly interested in sysadmin and security he then came into two books that were going to switch his focus from tech to programming. These books were “Programming in C” by King and the holy “Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs”. With the latter playing also a pivotal role in the development of his love for mathematics, Algebra in particular.

Groucho’s main interests span among: protocols for anonymous transactions, security, decentralized finance, game theory and cryptography. All topics he was used to read about only in sci-fi novels.

If you have any project in one of these areas just ping him, or if for any reason you’d like to contribute to Groucho’s studies, just hit him with a donation.
