Groucho showed up in the net at the time Telnet was ubiquitous and most of the tech conversations were happening over IRC (the best ones still are though). At that time in his small village the only place with a modest  connection was an internet point. He started to trade computer repairs for free access to the net.

Although mainly interested in sysadmin and security he then came into two books that were going to switch his focus from tech to programming. These books were “Programming in C” by King and the holy “Structure and Interpretation of computer programs”. With the latter playing also a pivotal role in the development of his love for mathematics, Algebra in particular.

At 19 he decided to pursue an academic career in Economics and Quantitative Finance, dreaming of a job in trading the financial markets. At that time finding profits looked to him like exploits in code. But whatever the excuses he was telling himself it was not his life and as soon as he finished his studies he went back to the keyboard and worked as a full stack software developer.

Then a working project put him in contact with the blockchain and the cryptocurrencies ecosystem. Witnessing how the application of cryptographic protocols and game theory could create new economic and social protocols made him rediscover his childhood passion of decentralized economies and anarchism.

Then he decided to quit his full time job in industry to research his ideas and to focus more on his studies.

Now his time is mainly spent studying mathematics with the aim of contributing (one day) to the fundamental research in areas concerning cryptography.

On the applied side his main interests span among decentralized finance, distributed governance, self sovereign identity and other topics he was used to read just in sci-fi novels.

This blog is intended to share Groucho’s notes about the topics he is interested into hoping somebody could find them useful.

Groucho needs your kind help to finance his studies
